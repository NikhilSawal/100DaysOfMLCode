# 100DaysOfMLCode

## Day 1 | Statistical Learning, Inference vs. Prediction  
Being the first day of the challenge, I decided to get used to the github environment and start with a little introduction to Machine 
Learning. The following infographic is a more simplified version of the [mathematical document](https://github.com/NikhilSawal/100DaysOfMLCode/blob/master/day%201/day%201.docx).  

So, why did I start with Statistical Learning?  
Because machine learning uses statistical techniques to give computers the ability to `learn` using data.

## Day 2 | [R Data types and Data structure (Vectors)]()  

On day 2, I have covered the basic data types and the data structure, vector (one dimensional arrays in other programming languages) in R.
Exploring and understanding the basics is really important, before we move to the more advanced machine learning applications. Plus it would be a good reference.
