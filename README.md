# 100DaysOfMLCode

## Day 1 | Statistical Learning, Inference vs. Prediction  
Being the first day of the challenge, I decided to get used to the github environment and start with a little introduction to Machine 
Learning. The following infographic is a more simplified version of the [mathematical document](https://github.com/NikhilSawal/100DaysOfMLCode/blob/master/day%201/day%201.docx).  

So, why did I start with Statistical Learning?  
Because machine learning uses statistical techniques to give computers the ability to `learn` using data.
